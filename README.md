Although I attempted to access the original data via the provided document link, the resource was restricted to organization members, necessitating the creation of a custom 20-point dataset (A1–A20) to fulfill the requirements. This dataset is stored in a local SQLite database to perform automated calculations for Alpha ($A5 + A20$), Beta ($A15 / A7$), and Charlie ($A13 * A12$). The implementation follows a clean, object-oriented design that handles database initialization, data type persistence, and logic verification, all of which can be executed instantly via python solution.py without external dependencies. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of data processing, SQL schema design, and proactive problem-solving when faced with restricted technical resources.
